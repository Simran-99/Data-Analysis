Zomato Data Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a Zomato dataset that has been custom-created for the purpose of SQL query demonstrations and answering specific research questions. The dataset includes four tables representing Gold users, products, users, and sales data. The queries aim to explore customer behavior, purchase patterns, and membership impacts.

Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of the following tables:

Gold Users Signup Table: Contains user IDs for customers with Gold memberships and the date of subscription.
Columns: userid, gold_signup_date
Product Table: Holds product information, including product ID, name, and price.
Columns: product_id, product_name, price
Users Table: Stores user IDs and their signup dates.
Columns: userid, signup_date
Sales Table: Records sales transactions, including user ID, product purchased, and order creation date.
Columns: userid, product_id, created_date
A script is included that generates this dataset, allowing for the execution of SQL queries aimed at answering various business and data exploration questions.
